AwesomeScheduler is a high-level scheduler powered by C++11 and Boost.

**Encadrant** : Bernard Glonneau [bg]  
**Développeurs** : Thibault Vieux [melkir] - Robin Lasnier [lasnierrob] - François Massot [massotfran]  
_____________________________________________________________________________  

**Starting : end-user sends a request to dispacher**  
 - dispatcher.cpp : Dispacher receiving work requests  
 - end-user.cpp : End-user sending work requests  

**Front-end processing in dispacher**  
 - dispatcher.cpp > std::priority_queue : After receiving work request
    the dispatcher add the work to the priority_queue and sort them by
    priority
 - worker.cpp : Receive the work from the dispatcher

**Software running in each worker (multi-thread monitoring)**  
 - Planified  

**Move a job from one machine to another**  
 - Planified  

**Miscellanous**  
 - task_properties.cpp : XML parser for work requests  
 - task[x].xml : Work unit properties for a task "x"

### Version
0.0.1

### Techologies
AwesomeScheduler uses a number of open source projects to work properly:  
* [C++] - compiled programming language  
* [Boost] - set of libraries for the C++ programming language  
* [OpenMP] - api that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming  
* [MPI] - standardized and portable message-passing system  

### Installation  
You need GCC, Boost and CMake installed :  

```sh
$ git clone http://gitlab.etude.eisti.fr/TeamAwesome/AwesomeScheduler.git
$ cd AwesomeScheduler
$ source build.sh
```

### Development
First Tab:  
```sh
$ ./Dispatcher
```

Second Tab:  
```sh
$ ./EndUser
```

Third Tab:
```sh
$ ./Worker
```

### Todo
 - Software running in each worker (multi-process monitoring)
 - Software running in each worker (multi-thread monitoring)
 - Add the possibility to move a job from one machine to another
